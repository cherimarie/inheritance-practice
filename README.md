## Associated Reading

## Learning objectives
Practicing prototypal inheritance and reading UML diagrams (chpt 13 review).

## Instructions
Write code that matches the diagrams. Functions can just console.log something, no need to worry about how theyâ€™d really work. Create the necessary prototypes with proper inheritance, and then the shown objects constructed from them. Call the methods and console.log some attributes from each object to test that they are working as expected.
